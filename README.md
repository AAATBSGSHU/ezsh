### *The easiest way to initialize a new .sh script*

If you want the script to be the most effective, add these lines to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:

```
# AAATBSGSHU
alias ezsh='/location/of/your/script/ezsh.sh'
```
To then run it just use ```ezsh /location/of/the/script/you/want/to/intialize/script.sh```
